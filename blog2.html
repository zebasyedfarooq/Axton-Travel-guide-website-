        <h2>5 REASONS WHY YOU NEED TO VISIT TURKEY</h2>
        <p>Turkey is often regarded as a cheap travel destination that’s packed full of British tourists looking for a boozy holiday but without paying for the expense of Ibiza. </p>
        <p>While you may find this in places like Bodrum, Turkey is 783,562 km² big, and still retains much of its history and ancient traditions.
            It also has a cuisine that is unlike anywhere else in the world, iconic landscapes, stunning beaches, and an ancient site that is regarded as one of the seven Ancient Wonders of the World.
            If you’ve been on the fence about visiting Turkey and need a little nudge out of the door, then be sure to read our 10 reasons to visit Turkey to understand why this majestic country should be near the top of anybody’s travel bucket list.</p>

        <h3>To Explore Istanbul: A Vibrant City That Rests in Two Continents </h3>
        <p>Istanbul is a city unlike anywhere else in the world. For one thing, it resides on the border of two continents, Europe and Asia, and aside from being able to put one foot in Asia and one foot in Europe, there are many other reasons to visit Istanbul.</p>
        <p>Istanbul was once known as Constantinople, the capital of the Roman Empire before it was seized by the Ottomans in 1453. 
            When the Ottomans took over, they turned the beautiful Hagia Sophia into a mosque, opened up The Grand Bazaar, the world’s largest covered market, and built several stunning palaces in Istanbul.
            The remnants of these two historic empires are still prominent in the city today. For history lovers, they will love exploring the ancient streets, or even under the streets, in one of the many of the city’s cisterns.</p>

        <h3>Share in a Once-In-A-Lifetime Hot Air Balloon Ride In Cappadocia</h3>
        <p>Cappadocia is a unique region in Turkey, known for its vast desert landscape housing distinctive rock formations known as fairy chimneys. These fairy chimneys were once natural caves formed by weathering, but centuries ago, they were carved out and used as houses for settlers.
            Hiking in Cappadocia is one way to see these unique rock formations, but to really experience the vastness of this landscape, is from above.
            Riding in a hot air balloon is one of the best things to do in Cappadocia. Unlike hot air balloon tours in other parts of the world, in Cappadocia, hot air balloons take flight at sunrise when wind conditions are better. 
            There are also hundreds of hot air balloons that take flight at once, filling the skies one after the other. There is nothing else quite like it. It’s definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>

        <h3>Experience a Relaxing Turkish Hammam (Turkish Bath)</h3>
        <p>A Hammam, or Turkish Bath, is a relaxing experience that can only be found in Turkey (mainly Istanbul).
            A Hammam is a steam bath or public bathing space introduced during the Ottoman era, which they adopted from the Romans. It’s a huge part of Islamic culture and is seen as a popular therapy method of cleansing – not just the body, but the mind. 
            As well as being a relaxing experience, a Turkish bath house is an excellent example of Roman and Greek architecture, with curved arches and mosaic tiles throughout.</p>

        <h3>To Visit The Oldest and Largest Covered Market in the World: The Grand Bazaar</h3>
        <p>The Grand Bazaar is a maze of street stalls selling everything from Turkish towels and Turkish lamps, to rugs, antiques, and sweet treats like baklava and Turkish delight.
            As well as getting all the souvenirs you could possibly want or need, the Grand Bazaar is also a place of historical importance. 
            It began in 1455 when the Ottomans captured Constantinople (now Istanbul). The market was the main point of trade in the Ottoman Empire, where everything from gold and precious gems to textiles and food products was sold.
            It is comprised of 61 streets and over 4,000 shops. Truly, The Grand Bazaar is a magical place that has to be seen to be believed and one of the best places to visit in Istanbul.</p>

        <h3>Ignite Your Culinary Senses With The Delicious Turkish Cuisine</h3>
        <p>Many people think of Turkish food as just kebabs. But in fact, there are many different dishes that can only be truly enjoyed when visiting Turkey. 
            Turkey is particularly good at desserts and sweet treats. Baklava, a pastry dish with pistachios and sugar syrup, is one of the most popular Turkish sweets and you’ll find it everywhere in Turkey, especially in Istanbul.
            Turkish rice pudding is also a delicious local delicacy you must try. Some desserts are also a little bit odd, such as Tavuk göğsü, a milk pudding with chicken in it (yes you read that right, chicken).
            As well as desserts, Turkey has several savory dishes you should check out. There’s Börek, a flakey pastry dish with meat and sometimes spinach. Then there’s Sarma, otherwise known as stuffed vine leaves. You should also try manti (a type of Turkish ravioli), pide (a pizza without the cheese), and gozleme (similar to a savory crepe).
            If you’re visiting Istanbul, you absolutely need to try the stuffed mussels!
            I’m sure by now you’ve realized that trying all the food in Turkey could take you weeks. This is definitely one of the top reasons to visit Turkey.</p>
