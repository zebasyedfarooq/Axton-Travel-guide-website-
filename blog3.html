        <h2>5 THINGS YOU CAN DO IN JAPAN</h2>
        <p>Whether you are living in Japan or travelling through; teaching, learning, or a bit of both, there are some experiences that are so totally Japanese that you just couldn’t get them anywhere else.
          By no means exclusive, this list of things to do in Japan should at least give you some great ideas to get you started on your journey of expat living and discovery through this fascinating country.</p>
        <img src="MySitePictures/bb1.jpg" alt="">
        <h3>1. Meoto Iwa </h3>
        <p>The unique blend of Buddhism with ancient Shinto beliefs is one of the things that make religion and culture in Japan so deeply interesting. A huge percentage of Japanese people still frequent spiritual sites all over the country on a regular basis, thus showing the importance of traditional beliefs in today’s Japanese society.S
            You’ll find beautiful Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines all across Japan, tucked away between skyscrapers and car dealerships, hidden on mountain-tops and sometimes right under your very nose.
            However, the most awe-inspiring and one of the most sacred Shinto sites in all of Japan is the Meoto Iwa. These spectacular “wedded rocks” rise majestically from the waves just off the coast of Ise, wedded by a sacred rope made of rice straw. They are part of the Futami Okitama Shrine.
            Shinto is the name for the indigenous spiritual beliefs of Japan, of which a large part is the worship of spirits inherent in natural forces such as rivers, trees and you guessed it, rocks.</p>

        <h3>2. A Night in a Manga-kissa</h3>
        <p>Japanese culture is characterised around the world by its unique blend of old and new. The age-old traditions and customs are sharply juxtaposed by ultra-modern cyber culture and the pinnacle of technology, and so that’s where we journey next, to the big city life!
            While visiting a sacred Shinto site is one way to integrate into Japanese culture, staying a night in a manga-kissa or Manga Cafe is another.
            A manga-kissa is a place where Japanese people go to read manga comics, use the internet, play video games and more. You are charged for the time that you spend there and many maga-kissas, such as Popeye or GeraGera, offer discounted overnight rates on private booths. There is often a TV, food and drink, and even a shower and bathroom!</p>

        <h3>3. Eat Japanese food</h3>
        <p>While most Japanese food is loved by visitors, there are a few notable exceptions. Like marmite, here are a few Japanese favourites you’ll either love or hate. Developing an acquired taste for them is a major step towards becoming bona fide Japanese.
            Nankotsu – Sometimes off-puttingly translated as “softbones”. This is one of Japan’s most popular snacks. Made of deep fried chicken cartilage, it’s the texture that’ll get you. Once you get your head around that, you may even grow to love them.
            Nattou – Fermented beans! Need I say more? This revolting smell cannot be accurately described here. You’ll just have to try it for yourself.
            Takoyaki – Probably the easiest of the three to get your head around, these hot, battered Octopus balls are topped with an unusual array of sauces and dried fish flakes to taste. It could go either way.</p>
        <img src="MySitePictures/bb4.jpg" alt="">
        <h3>4. The Tea Ceremony</h3>
        <p>One of the most fascinating customs in the world, the Japanese tea ceremony or “Way of tea” can tell you more about Japanese culture than anything else! If you are lucky enough to be invited to one, you cannot afford to pass up the opportunity.
            Revolutionised by Sen no Rikyu in the 16th Century, the tea ceremony embodies the principles of respect, harmony, tranqility and purity, and is firmly linked to Zen Buddhism.
            Sen no Rikyu was one of the most influential people to ever live in Japan. He taught that each “meeting” was to be treasured while it lasted, as no other would ever be the same, and developed the concept of Wabi – where the focus is not on show or adornments but on simplicity and natural beauty.
            After a disagreement with his master, Rikyu was ordered to commit ritual suicide. His philosophies, however, live on, and can be seen in almost every aspect of Japanese life today.</p>

        <h3>5. Visit Hokkaido</h3>
        <p>Finally, you’ll never feel that your trip to Japan was complete without a journey to the far eastern shores of Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan’s main four islands. It might seem like a bit of a trek, but this is the adventure that’ll either make or break you on your journey to becoming Japanese.
            Leave Western culture and the big cities behind and journey into Japan’s rich past as you cross beautiful Aomori Prefecture and arrive on Hokkaido. Here you’ll discover an abundance of beautiful scenery, countless national parks that are perfect for hiking and other outdoor activities, and very few tourists to get in the way of your awe-inspiring photos.
            Hokkaido is also home of the Sapporo brewery and the Yoichi distillery (which is fast gaining critical acclaim on the world whisky scene), as well as being the last place on earth to see the Ainu – Japan’s native population.
            The Ainu have undergone centuries of discrimination and persecution and are only now beginning to be accepted as an integral part of Japanese culture. There are traditional villages such as Nibutani where you can visit the Ainu and learn about their unique language, religion, music and cuisine. Very few Japanese people make this journey, and even fewer tourists.
            Pull it off and no-one can deny that you know your stuff when it comes to Japan.</p>
            
            <p>Good luck! Ganbatte!</p>
