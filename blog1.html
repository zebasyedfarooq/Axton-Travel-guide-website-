        <h2>HOW TO SPEND 4 DAYS IN PARIS:THINGS TO DO + ITINERARY GUIDE</h2>
        <p>Paris, the City of Love, is one of the most popular travel destinations in the world. With its rich history, iconic landmarks, and unrivaled cuisine, it’s no surprise that millions of visitors flock to this city every year.Our family visited Paris during the summer for four nights and had an incredible time. Four days in Paris is the perfect amount of time to spend in the city if you’re planning on visiting other destinations in France or Europe.Out of our month long trip in Europe visiting five countries, our teenage daughters said Paris was their favorite.</p>
        <p>If you’re planning a trip to Paris for the first time, it can be overwhelming to decide what to see and where to stay. That’s why we’ve put together a comprehensive 4-day Paris itinerary to help you make the most of your time in the City of Lights.
        Our itinerary for Paris is the perfect mix of top attractions and Parisian life experiences. From visiting the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum to enjoying a croissant at a quaint café, we’ve got your sightseeing, dining, and accommodation needs covered.</p>
        <img src="MySitePictures/1.jpg" alt="">
        <h3>Are 4 days enough for Paris?</h3>
        <p>But first, you may be wondering if you have enough time at your disposal. If you’re wondering if four days is enough to see Paris, then be assured you have the perfect amount of time to enjoy the city.
            Most of the city’s top attractions can be viewed in two full days, but my allowing yourself four days, you can explore the city at a slower pace and take time out to experience Parisian life such as relaxing in a garden with a picnic or sitting in a cafe eating patiseries.
            The French, particularly Parisians, are always rushing and have some place to be, but when it comes to enjoying a coffee or a meal, they love to take their time take the time.
            So when in Paris, do as the Parisians do, and savour those minutes of peace when you’re not on the busy streets!</p>
        <h3>How to use this 4 Days in Paris Itinerary</h3>
        <p>How you plan your days in Paris will depend upon where you are staying and how you want to get around. For us, we like to walk as much as possible, and then use the Paris Metro or trains when needed.
            One of the biggest mistakes we made on our Europe trip was catching a taxi from Charles de Gaulle airport, and then later renting a car from there to drive down to the Loire Valley. If you need a car for further travels in France, hire it outside the city ring road as Paris traffic is a NIGHTMARE.
            For those needing things to do in 4 days, we have grouped each day for attractions that are nearby each other to reduce traveling time. That means you can walk for most of this itinerary.
            Feel free to adapt to suit your interests and time frame and for when you can book attraction tickets, which we recommend you do far in advance, especially for the Eiffel Tower.</p>
        <img src="MySitePictures/2.jpg" alt="">
        <h3>Day 1: Montparnasse to The River Seine</h3>
        <p>This was our easy first day in Paris, combining some star attractions with neighborhood wanderings and cafe people watching.The Paris Catacombs are a series of underground ossuaries that hold the remains of more than six million people. Each of their graves is placed in the rock walls inside the tunnel network. They were built to deal with the overflowing cemetery problem in the late 1700s.
            It’s best to take a guided tour or at least an audio guide, so you can learn all about its creation and uses, as well as to find your way around this underground maze!
            Book your tickets as early as you can, and for the first time opening (9:45am) As it’s only a 15-minute walk from Montparnasse Tower, it’s perfect to do on this day exploring Paris, and will fit nicely with the rest of the day’s activities.
            The Catacombs of Paris was the only attraction on our list of things to do in Paris we could not do because of timing. Since you’re in this area, I highly recommend it, and will do it on a return trip to Paris.</p>
        <p>At 210 meters tall, the Montparnasse Tower is the tallest building in Paris. It features an outdoor observatory deck on the 56th floor that provides stunning panoramic views of Paris, including, the Eiffel Tower.
            You can see all the famous landmarks from up here, from The Louvre to The Panthéon and more. I loved seeing how excited my girls got at finally seeing the Eiffel Tower in real life!
            Sunset from here is meant to be spectacular, if you want to do it then. Just be aware, it’s the busiest time for the tower.</p>
        <p>We had planned to eat at Bouillon Chartier – after a Parisian friend’s recommendation – but as soon as my teen saw the pretty flower-covered Montparnasse Café next door, she begged for us to eat there instead.
            Parisian café life is something to indulge in and the pretty the exterior the better, so we were thrilled to sit at a table outside under the warmth of the sun, surrounded by floral love, eating our first delicious French meal. The food was great and service wonderful and was the perfect rest we needed as we recovered from jet lag.</p>
        <p>Walk off your lunch, and take a break within the beauty of Jardin Du Luxembourg. This meticulously manicured park, spread across 25 hectares, combines a harmonious blend of nature, art, and history, making it a must-visit destination for travelers seeking tranquility and beauty.
            Lush green lawns, vibrant flowerbeds, and meticulously trimmed hedges create a picturesque landscape that is straight out of a fairytale. The gardens boast over a hundred statues, fountains, and monuments, each adding a touch of grandeur to the already captivating scenery (which also includes an orchard!)</p>
        <p>The gardens also have a large pond where you can go boating, and there’s a playground and a puppet theatre that your kids will love. Kids will also love walking a pony through the grounds.
            You may want to have a picnic lunch here instead of the aforementioned cafe. Grab supplies from any nearby market or boulangerie.
            This neighborhood, known for its literary heritage, exudes an intellectual and bohemian ambiance. It’s a mecca for food, shopping, great museums, and bustling city life. We loved this neighborhood a lot. Explore the iconic St Germain neighborhood, with stops at :
            Pierre Hermé, a legendary pastry chef in Paris, famous for indulgent macarons. They were sensational, and we had no lines, unlike some other famous macaron places in Paris.
            Discover the oldest chocolate shop, Debauve & Gallais. Marie Antoinette adored their chocolates, claiming they made her medicine go down easier. You can even buy the chocolates she liked. Note, the chocolate here is expensive!!
            Le Deux Magots and Café de Flore, pretty cafes famous hangouts for literary greats and stars.
            Cour du Commerce Saint-Andre: step back in time to the world of 1734 when small shops lined the (almost hidden) narrow lane paved with cobblestones
            Cafe Procope is known as the oldest cafe in Paris and is here bon vivants mingled with future revolutionaries.</p>
        <p>After all that walking, you’ll be ready to view Paris from the seat of your pants. Take a seat on a Seine River Cruise to soak in the romantic atmosphere of the city.
            The river cruises offer stunning views of some of Paris’ most famous landmarks, including Notre Dame Cathedral, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Pari’s many rivers, all with their own stories to tell.
            We highly recommend one with narration so you can learn a little bit about Paris and France as you float down the Seine River! There are multiple cruise companies and departure points.
            We recommend Pont Neuf as you’ll be exploring right near it. It’s also the one we did and found it to be fantastic! Click here for rates and availability.</p>
        <img src="MySitePictures/5.webp" alt="">
        <h3>Day 2: Montmartre to Sainte Chapelle</h3>
        <p>I think this was my favorite day in Paris as we got to enjoy a delicious food tour in one of my favorite neighborhoods, the enchanting Montmartre, and explore the surprisingly stunning Sainte Chapelle.</p>
        <p>Catch the metro to Marie D’aubervillers for at least half a day exploring the enchanting Montmartre. Right near the Metro station is the Wall of Love, you may want to pop into for a quick photo.
            Then grab a pastry and coffee to go from a nearby cafe to explore freely before your food walking tour (you won’t need a big breakfast!).
            The most famous Parisian district perched on top of a small hill retains its village atmosphere that appealed so much to the artists of the 19th and 20th centuries.
            Discover the hidden squares and quaint cafes along the cobble stone streets of Montmartre that inspired countless artists throughout the years. Artist’s Square is the most well-known area and a little too touristy now, but worth a stroll through.
            We’ll visit the famous Basilica of the Sacré-Coeur after the food tour.</p>
        <p>As our favorite thing to do in Paris, we recommend adding a Montmartre Food tour to your Paris itinerary.
            The walking tour of Montmartre included six food stops (mix of savory and sweet), and wine tasting. We learned so much about Paris history and culture of this bohemian neighborhood in Paris. We tried so much delicious food from baguettes and cheese to omelets and croissants.</p>
        <p>You will finish your food tour at the bottom of Sacre Coeur, so now it’s time to explore it. Since you learned quite a bit about it on the food tour, it doesn’t have to be as in-depth.
            Perched atop a hill, this stunning white-domed basilica offers panoramic views of the city. Enjoy them on the stairs before you go inside to look at the exquisite mosaics and stained glass windows, and enjoy its peaceful interior. The basilica is free to go inside and will not take up much of your time.</p>
        <p>I feel the star attraction of a visit to the Basilica is its stunning exterior, and climb to its 200m dome. This paid attraction is worth it for a sprawling cityscape of Paris, overlooking the winding streets of Montmartre, and the iconic landmarks that dot the horizon.
            It was also a fun climb up narrow winding stairs, along different sections of the roof, and around the small balcony. 
            Next door to the Basilica (Paris’ newest church) is Church of Saint-Pierre de Montmartre, (Paris’ oldest church). It’s free to enter and won’t take long.
            I only went in as I wanted to see the statue of Saint Dennis holding his head. We learned about him on the food tour. He is the patron Saint of Paris, and is who Montmartre was named after – the Mount of the Martyr.
            If you’re tired of exploring Montmartre, you could add in Marais district (see options below) or jump on the metro to head straight to Sainte Chapelle (another favorite Paris attraction of mine)</p>
        <p>Situated on Paris’s picturesque island, Île de la Cité, is the Sainte-Chapelle Cathedral, famous for its beautiful stained-glass windows. There are 1,113 of them and they depict scenes from the Bible and cover almost the entirety of the walls and reach up to 40 meters in height.
            The light that streams through the windows casts beautiful colors throughout the cathedral, making it a truly magical place. My jaw literally dropped when I walked up the stairs and into the room. It is one of the most beautiful places in Paris, so don’t make sure you have it on your Paris itinerary! And good news – it doesn’t take too long!</p>
        <p>If you have time and are interested, you may also want to include a visit to the The Conciergerie, which Sainte Chappelle was once a part of.
            It began as a royal palace in the 6th Century but today its most famous as the infamous French Revolution tribunal and prison where Marie-Antoinette spent her final days awaiting her fate at the guillotine.
            We contemplated it as our teen, Kalyra is fascinated with Marie Antoinette. But we were pretty tired by this stage and decided to skip it, as I heard mixed reviews. You don’t always have to do everything, and you can always leave things to return to Paris for.</p>
        <p>Right near Sainte Chapelle is the famous Notre Dame. It’s been closed since 2019 because of the large fire partially destroyed the upper part of Notre-Dame Cathedral -its roof and spire. It is meant to reopen in December 2024.
            You can still visit the cathedral square, which looks onto both the crypt and the cathedral’s entrance. We were happy with seeing it from our Seine River Cruise as it navigated around the island where it sits.</p>
        <p>On the other side of the island is the vibrant Latin Quarter. It’s the student area, so expect a lively atmosphere amongst its narrow streets filled with restaurants, cafes, museums, and churches.</p>

        <h3>Day 3: Eiffel Tower to the Louvre</h3>
        <p>Paris is all about immersing yourself in the city’s rich history and iconic landmarks, and today is that day! You’ll embark on a journey from the Eiffel Tower to the Louvre. Don’t forget to book your tickets in advance and move the schedule around to cater to that.</p>
        <p>Start your day by heading to the Eiffel Tower, the most emblematic symbol of Paris, and a must visit for any traveler in Paris. Allow time before our after your visit to walk around the tower taking your photos and marveling at its intricate iron lattice structure as you approach it.
         We absolutely loved climbing the stairs, rather than taking the elevator – it’s makes the journey a star attraction. Tickets for the third level were sold out, but I’ve been told first and second levels have the best views anyway.</p>
        <p>Soak in the beauty of Paris from this bird’s eye perspective of the city’s stunning skyline, with landmarks like the Louvre, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Seine River coming into view. Capture memorable photos, enjoy the refreshing breeze, and let the city’s charm enchant you.
            If you’re feeling adventurous, indulge in a glass of champagne or wine at the cafe located on the first floor, or Champagne Bar at the very top. Our girls enjoyed an ice cream while we had an affordable chardonnay to toast to the magic of Paris.</p>
        <p>We recommend dong it first thing to avoid huge crowds (it will still be busy) and for decent lighting for photos as the sun won’t be too high yet.
            For an added touch of romance, you could also visit around sunset. As the sky transforms into a palette of vibrant colors, witness the Eiffel Tower lighting up, illuminating the city with its magical glow. (If you want to do that, just flip this day’s itinerary, and start at the Louvre!)</p>
        <p>Now it’s time to make your way to one of my favorite views in Paris from the rooftop of the majestic Arc de Triomphe, which stands proudly at the western end of the Champs Elysée.
            This iconic monument was built in 1836 commemorates the victories of the French army and offers a breathtaking view of the city from its rooftop terrace. don’t be like me and only do this top Paris attraction on your third visit to this city!
            I must have been too enamored with the traffic circling around the Charles de Gaulle roundabout below thinking that was the main event!From the top of the arc, you can look down and see the bustling scenes on the Champs-Élysées, as well as look over towards the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. You can read our full guide on how to visit the Arc de Triomphe. (and take the stairs – the spiraling staircase is cool!)</p>
        <p>While I think one of the most iconic avenues in the world, the Champs-Élysées, is overrated, I still think it’s worth including this in our Paris itinerary. This grand boulevard stretches for approximately two kilometers, and is lined with elegant shops, cafes, and theaters.
            You’ll find flagship stores of world-renowned brands, such as Louis Vuitton and Cartier, offering a luxury shopping experience. Surprisingly, my teenage girls also weren’t that enthused by it.</p>
        <p>You’re probably hungry now so indulge in some people-watching at one of the many outdoor cafes that line the avenue. Grab a seat, sip on a café au lait, and relish the Parisian ambiance. We ate alfresco style at Le Deauville Brassiere and were surprised that it wasn’t hugely expensive.
            We had a great craft coffee (and smoothie for the girls) just off Champs Elysée at Azur Cafe just off the Champs Elysée. The food here is also pretty and instagrammable.
            On Champs Elysée you’ll find long lines outside Laduree Bakery and Tearoom for their famous macarons. Unless you’re a devout fan, get your macarons elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Keep walking along the Champs Elysée as it will take you to your next stop, the magnificent Tuileries Gardens. On the way, you’ll pass by the Place de la Concorde, marked by the Luxor Obelisk in the middle of it. Created in 1772, it was was the place for French Revolution executions, including Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette.
            The Tuileries Garden is an iconic Parisian destination that should be on every visitor’s list of free things to do in Paris. It’s a beautiful park with lush green lawns, tranquil ponds, and flower gardens.
            Originally created in the 16th century by Catherine de Medici, the garden has a long and rich history and is home to some of the most famous landmarks in Paris, including the Musée de l’Orangerie and the Grand Bassin Rond.</p>
        <p>Aet enthusiasts may want to make time to see Claude Monet’s iconic Water Lilies at the Musée de l’Orangerie. We were content to stroll and sit on the many chairs within the park to enjoy the views and the shade and watch Paris life go by.
            The views of the Louvre from Jardin des Tuileries were my favorite.</p>
        <p>Exploring the Louvre Museum is one of the best things to do in Paris. It is home to some of the most famous art in the world, such as the Winged Victory of Samothrace and Venus de Milo by Alexandros of Antioch.
            But perhaps the most iconic piece of work is Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, one of the great masterpieces from the Italian Renaissance.
            The museum is massive, with more than 35,000 works of art on display. It can be overwhelming, so plan ahead and decide which exhibits you want to see.</p>
        <p>No one in our family was enthusiastic about visiting. It’s my third trip to Paris and I STILL have not been inside the Louvre. I don’t feel any remorse or regret about it. I know one day I will go, but we’re not huge art and museum people, and spending the required time for the Louvre just took us away from other things we knew we’d enjoy more.
            These are the kinds of decisions you need to make on your travels – what do you REALLY want? What would LIGHT you up and create those stories and memories to share forever more?</p>
        <p>We did really enjoy the beauty of the Louvre’s exterior – it’s a masterpiece of architectural grandeur. The iconic glass pyramid at the entrance serves as a striking contrast to the historic buildings surrounding it, adding a touch of modernity to the museum’s facade.
            The museum was originally built as a royal palace in the 16th century, and its grandeur is still evident today.
            Now you’re back in Central Paris and you have free time! Wander more, add in any other attractions you wanted to see or do, or just relax with happy hour and dinner in a cafe in St Germain or the Latin Quarter.</p>
        <img src="MySitePictures/2.jpg" alt="">
        <h3>Day 4: Visit the Palace of Versailles</h3>
        <p>No trip to Paris is complete without a visit to the magnificent Palace of Versailles. While quite a big and tiring day, it was a Paris experience our family really loved. Visiting Château de Versailles is an opportunity to immerse yourself in the opulence and grandeur of French royalty and learn some French history along the way.
            You can get to Versailles by train in around 30 minutes, depending on where you’re leaving from. As soon as you arrive, you’ll be struck by the sheer size and beauty of the palace grounds, spanning over 2,000 acres of meticulously manicured gardens and awe-inspiring architecture.
            Due to its vast size, it’s best to plan for an entire day to explore the Palace of Versailles.</p>
        <p>We have a post on planning a day trip to Versailles from Paris, outlining how to schedule the various activities you can do while there from within the palace, through its gardens, and further to the parklands, and “miniature” palaces and hamlets.
            Once inside the Palace, prepare to be transported back in time as you explore the lavishly decorated rooms, each one more breathtaking than the last.
            Marvel at the Hall of Mirrors, adorned with dazzling chandeliers and intricate frescoes, where historic treaties were signed, and royal balls were held. Wander through the King’s and Queen’s Apartments, adorned with priceless works of art, ornate furniture, and exquisite tapestries that showcase the wealth and extravagance of the French monarchy.</p>
        <p>After exploring the palace interiors, take a leisurely stroll through the sprawling gardens, designed by famed landscape architect André Le Nôtre. Admire the meticulously manicured lawns, beautiful fountains, and charming hidden groves that make this UNESCO World Heritage site a true oasis of tranquility.
           We highly recommend hiring bikes or a golf cart to get around. A highlight for many when visiting the palace grounds is to enjoy a picnic with supplies brought in from the nearby Versailles market. Our chosen spot was in the Queen’s Hamlet which was so tranquil and pretty.
            Taking out a rowboat on the Grand Canal also adds to the regal experience of Versailles.</p>
